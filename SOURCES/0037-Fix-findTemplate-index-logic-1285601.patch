Subject: [PATCH 37/55] Fix findTemplate index logic (#1285601)

The fallback case where findTemplate has to look for the first entry
contained a logic flaw that could return an incorrect index. This
discovered index should be reduced by one for each boot entry that will
be skipped in the final output. The flaw occurred because the index
variable was used for the loop upper bound at the same time as it was
being decremented within the actual loop body. The loop would thus fail
to examine a number of boot entries equal to the total number of
iterations the loop performed.
